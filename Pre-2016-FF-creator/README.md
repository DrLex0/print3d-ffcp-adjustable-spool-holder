# About

These are modified parts of my FlashForge Creator Pro 2016 adjustable spool holder such that they fit the older Creator and Creator Pro models (from 2015 and earlier) which use round holes for mounting the spool holders. This model also offsets the holders similarly to the [model by ajwammock](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:863358), such that there is extra room for larger spools. Print these files instead of the ‘Base’ model from the top-level directory.

This was made on request from [enriquem50](https://www.thingiverse.com/enriquem50). The photo in the main README is from his [make](https://www.thingiverse.com/make:534462).

For printing and assembly instructions, see the top-level README file.

There is a closed and an open model for the mounting knob, which one you'll want to use depends on whether you want to completely seal your enclosure or leave some ventilation holes.

If you plan to use the 55 mm end piece, you should take extra care to print the base and fastener in a strong way because they will need to endure extra stress (moreover the reason why you would want the long end piece is probably because you have a huge and heavy spool to start with…)
